    		This is our abstract for an educational project as part of our course.
    		<br>
    		<br>
    		Often we have to stand in long queues to checkout after
			shopping and even then wait for billing of each of our
			products. This is quite a time consuming process. By digitising
			this whole process we can save up a lot of time.
			<br>
			<br>
			We aim to remove the checkout counters and enable a
			person to just walk in the store and take what he wants. The
			basic idea behind it is to use a person’s fingerprint to
			authorise him/her to take a product from the shelves. This
			part of the process would require a fingerprint scanner(to
			validate a person) , a solenoid(to enable locking of shelf),a
			Ultrasound sensor( to check if the product is taken or
			whether the person has put it back, so we don’t charge
			him/her).
			<br>
			<br>
			Using method of sensor fusion (i.e if Person is validated,
			shelf is unlocked, and Ultrasound sensor tells that product
			has been taken) we would charge the person according to
			price of item. This would require an App(requires app
			development) which would be given the product details as
			input and would total the bill till the person is done shopping.
			In the end we would need to use an e-wallet service like
			PayTM to complete the transaction, which can be done by
			using its API.
